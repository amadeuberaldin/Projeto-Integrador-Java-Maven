# Integrative Project: Minha Dispen√ßa

In this project, I was able to enhance the user experience, making the application much more user-friendly. Since this project was undertaken after completing all the tasks in my course, I was able to apply all the techniques developed throughout the course. This made the project much more intuitive, both in terms of programming and user interaction.

The project allowed me to refine my skills and implement a variety of concepts and best practices I learned during my studies. This resulted in a more polished and accessible program for end-users.
